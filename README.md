## About:

####Markup : * Main objective of this project is to design a fuzzy logic system which are used as a problem solving method based on human reasoning in defining levels of the capability of the children in retaining information within a short period of time. 
#### * The system will integrate in such a way that the teachers will be able to get the results of the childrenâ€™s performance in engaging with the experiments in variance of cognitive visual perceptual task and auditory processing performance. 
#### * Objectives:

- [x] To design a Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) in evaluating the levels of visual and auditory capacity among special needs children.

- [x] To develop an API that integrates between experiment stimulus (digit span) and Mamdani FLS.

## Installation Guide:

<b>1. To run the application, make sure Python is installed on the computer. You may download from this link : https://www.python.org/downloads/ </b>

<b>2. Install xampp for the database application. You may download here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html </b>

<b>3. Install PIP. Python 3.7 came with PIP pre-installed. To be safe, update your PIP to the latest version using following command. </b>

-`python -m pip install --U pip`

<b>4. Install the following library using these commands in the terminal: </b>

-`pip install numpy`

-`pip install scipy`

-`pip install -U scikit-fuzzy`

-`pip install Flask`
