## About:

#### * Main objective of this project is to design a fuzzy logic system which are used as a problem solving method based on human reasoning in defining levels of the capability of the children in retaining information within a short period of time. 
#### * The system will integrate in such a way that the teachers will be able to get the results of the children’s performance in engaging with the experiments in variance of cognitive visual perceptual task and auditory processing performance. 
#### * Objectives:

- [x] To design a Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) in evaluating the levels of visual and auditory capacity among special needs children.

- [x] To develop an API that integrates between experiment stimulus (digit span) and Mamdani FLS.

## Installation Guide:

<b>1. To run the application, make sure Python is installed on the computer. You may download from this link : https://www.python.org/downloads/ </b>

<b>2. Install xampp for the database application. You may download here: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html </b>

<b>3. Install PIP. Python 3.7 came with PIP pre-installed. To be safe, update your PIP to the latest version using following command. </b>

-`python -m pip install --U pip`

<b>4. Install the following library using these commands in the terminal: </b>

-`pip install numpy`

-`pip install scipy`

-`pip install -U scikit-fuzzy`

-`pip install Flask`

-`pip install matplotlib`

-`pip install mysql-connector-python`
